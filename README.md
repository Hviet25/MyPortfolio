## Objective:
## Professional Experience:
### **Business Analyst Intern**
#### **XBOSS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS**
  + Overview:

    + Built a Human Resource Management (HRM) system using Odoo ERP, focusing on recruitment, employee contracts, work scheduling, attendance, and payroll.
  + Responsibilities:

    + Configured working hours and contract settings to define shift rules and weekly working hour requirements.
    + Used the Odoo Attendance module to track employee check-in/out times, calculate overtime, and identify missing work hours.
    + Establish employee leave policies and holiday calendars that align with organizational planning.
    + Managed timekeeping operations and ensured accurate attendance records to support payroll and HR reporting.
  + Technologies: Python, Odoo, PostgreSQL, Draw.io, Excel 
## Project:
### Airbnb Price Prediction with What-If Scenario Analysis
 **Code**: [Airbnb](https://github.com/Hviet25/MyProject/blob/main/Airbnb/airbnb.ipynb)
 
 **Goal**: To evaluate the impact of what-if scenarios on Airbnb listing prices using machine learning.
 
 **Description**: The dataset reflects the interaction between supply features, host credibility, and market feedback in determining Airbnb listing prices. This project involves loading and cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building an ETL pipeline for feature engineering, training and evaluating multiple machine learning models for price prediction, and applying what-if scenario analysis to generate actionable pricing insights.
 
 **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, GridSearchCV

 **Result**: 
    
  + Trained and compared multiple machine learning models to predict Airbnb listing prices and selected the best-performing model using cross-validation.
  + Conducted what-if scenario analysis to quantify how changes in listing features (e.g., accommodates, bathrooms, room type, cleaning fee, and review score) affect price.
  + Translated model predictions into actionable pricing insights rather than standalone forecasts.

### Enrollee Retention Prediction with Machine Learning and LLM Reasoning
  **Code**: [Enrollee](https://github.com/Hviet25/MyProject/blob/main/Enrollee/LLM_Reasoning.ipynb)

  **Goal**: To predict post-training employee retention using machine learning and enhance prediction interpretability through AI-agent–based LLM reasoning.
  
  **Description**: This project integrates data from multiple sources, including CSV, Excel, HTML tables, and Google Sheets, to predict whether an enrollee remains employed after completing a training program. Each data source is first explored independently through exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by an ETL pipeline to clean, transform, and standardize the data. The processed datasets are then combined into a unified analytical dataset. Machine learning models are applied to estimate the probability of post-training retention, and feature importance analysis is conducted to identify key factors influencing employee retention. Finally, an AI agent powered by GPT-3.5-turbo is used to generate LLM-based reasoning that explains model predictions in a human-interpretable manner.

  **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, ETL pipelines, Feature Engineering, Random Forest, Decision Tree, LangChain, LangGraph, GPT-3.5-turbo, Prompt Engineering, Data Visualization

  **Result**: 
  + Built an end-to-end pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources into a unified dataset for analysis.
  + Developed machine learning models to predict the probability of an enrollee remaining employed after completing a training program.
  + Achieved reliable predictive performance, enabling meaningful estimation of retention likelihood.
  + Identified key factors influencing employee retention through feature importance analysis.
  + Implemented an AI-agent–driven LLM reasoning layer to generate human-readable explanations for model predictions.
  + Transformed model outputs into interpretable insights to support data-informed workforce decisions.

### Database Agent Query
  **Code**: 
  [Database Agent Query with UI](https://github.com/Hviet25/MyProject/tree/main/database_agent_ui)
  [Database Agent Query Notebook]()
  **Goal**: To convert natural language user questions into executable SQL queries using an AI-agent–driven pipeline.

  **Description**: This project focuses on building an AI-agent–driven pipeline that converts user questions into executable SQL queries. Users can input natural language questions, after which the AI agent first checks whether the question is relevant to the underlying database schema. If the generated SQL query is valid and successfully executed, the system proceeds to generate the final answer. If the SQL query is invalid, the agent regenerates the query and repeats the process within a predefined number of iterations. Once the maximum number of regeneration attempts is reached, the pipeline terminates the loop and returns a final response. In addition, the project includes a Streamlit-based user interface that allows users to submit questions and receive answers in the form of visualizations and human-readable insights.

  **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, RDBMS, LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI GPT, Prompt Engineering, AI Agents, Streamlit

  **Result**: 
  + Successfully implemented an AI-agent–driven pipeline that converts natural language questions into executable SQL queries.
  + Enabled automatic relevance checking to ensure only schema-compatible questions are processed.
  + Achieved robust SQL execution through iterative query regeneration with controlled iteration limits.
  + Generated accurate query results and transformed them into human-readable insights.
  + Built an interactive Streamlit interface that allows users to submit questions and receive visualizations and insights in real time.
  + Demonstrated an end-to-end NL2SQL system that integrates reasoning, validation, and user-facing analytics.
